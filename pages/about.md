Ketman Project is a comprehensive threat intelligence platform combining traditional IOC tracking with advanced behavioral analysis across the open-source ecosystem. At its core, it's both an investigation platform and a suite of OSINT tools focused on detecting malicious actors through their patterns in open-source contributions, package publications, and cross-platform activities. The platform is built around a powerful yet intuitive search engine that enables both technical and non-technical researchers to uncover threat actor networks and attribute campaigns. Our tooling and datasets specialize in detecting fake developer profiles, supply chain attacks, and malware distribution networks by establishing hard-to-notice relationships between clusters of threat actors. Beyond tools, Ketman maintains an active investigation portal that provides real-time analysis of ongoing malicious campaigns, supported by data generated from our in-house tooling.
