We recommend reading ["Introducing Ketman Project"](https://ketman.org/introducing-ketman-project.html) for a detailed breakdown of our approach to threat intelligence and open source software security.

## What We Do

We're experience-driven, consistently updating our techniques, tactics, and procedures for securing the open source ecosystem. Our expertise includes:

* Active **threat hunting for DPRK IT Workers and other impersonators** in the software development space
* Assessing **risks for open source** organizations, **red teaming hiring** pipelines, and evaluating remote contributors
* Developing **automated software solutions for organizations** and security teams
* Deep **digital due diligence** leveraging battle-tested experience

Parts of this work are done as a public good service (We don't expect getting paid for reporting discovered DPRK in your organization during our regular scanning activity) and open source software development (We make the code available for some of the tools built).

## When We Can Help

* You require **background checks** on current or past contributors. You want to verify contributors are who they claim to be.
* You need to **eliminate potential entry points into your organization** via remote contributors
* You're dealing with excessive **PR/Issue spam**
* You require an **evaluation of your partnership team's security** and quality
* You want to stay informed about the **latest insider threats and their TTPs**

## How We Can Help

* We have extensive experience **uncovering deeply hidden threat actors** through standard and automated investigative methodologies
* We leverage a **curated and industry-unique dataset** of active threat actors
* We possess **strong professional experience** in both threat intelligence and security software development
* We operate **24/7/365**
* We can actively **protect your organization in real-time** through the deployment of software solutions

In his Religions and Philosophies of Central Asia, Gobineau describes the practice of Ketman, the act of paying lip service to Islam while concealing secret opposition. Describing the practice as widespread throughout the Islamic World, Gobineau quotes one of his informants as saying, "There is not a single true Moslem in Persia." Gobineau further describes the use of Ketman to secretly spread heterodox views to people who believe that they are being taught Islamic orthodoxy.
